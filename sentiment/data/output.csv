"A new duo camera for the iPhone 13 improves clarity in images, while the introduction of the company’s Sensor Shift optical image stabilization (OIS) technology, previously only available on Apple’s Pro Max handsets, is a big deal for those who want to shoot quickly without losing their subject in a blur.",Positive
"Bottom line. After testing all four iPhone 13 models, it's clear to me that the standard iPhone 13 is good enough to be the best option for most people. It's affordable and has the same performance, battery life and camera features as its Pro equivalent.",Positive
"The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini look similar to the Pro models but have a few differences. They both have an aluminum housing instead of stainless steel and five bright color options. There's Product(RED), starlight (an off-white color), midnight (black), pink and blue.",Positive
"Things get interesting when it comes to performance and the overall experience of the iPhone 13 On the inside, the phones are practically identical to the Pro models, save for a smaller battery in the Mini. They both feature the same A15 Bionic processor, 5G connectivity, and a brighter OLED display.",Positive
"Here's a round-up of the biggest issues reported with the iPhone 13 so far. Check back for updates on when these problems get fixed, and we'll also keep an eye out for any additional bug reports.",Negative
"There are two issues at play here. For starters, Apple says that app makers need to flag their software with a declaration they can support 120Hz. Apple plans to clarify this requirement to developers. Second, Apple plans to fix a bug involving animations built using the company's Core Animation tools; that fix is coming soon via a software update",Positive
"The new iPhones may not have restored Touch ID, allowing you to unlock your phone with a fingerprint, but there is a workaround for unlocking your phone when you're wearing a face mask and Face ID won't work. Earlier this year, the iOS 14.5 update added the ability to unlock your phone with a face mask on if you were also wearing an Apple Watch.",Positive
"Several users say that the new iPhones aren't responding to taps. Specifically, it sometimes takes several taps for the iPhone to recognize your input. The problem flares up with Tap to Wake and on the lock screen as well as iOS-wide incidents. Upper corners of the screen seem to be most vulnerable to this issue.",Negative
"This one's not so much a bug, but a feature. The iPhone 13 Pro models feature a new macro mode that uses the phone's 12MP ultrawide camera. Try to shoot an object that's within 5.5 inches of the lens, and the phone will shift from the main wide lens to the ultrawide shooter. Apple says this approach is better for capturing close-up details.",Positive
